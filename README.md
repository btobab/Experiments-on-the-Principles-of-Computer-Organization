## Experiments-on-the-Principles-of-Computer-Organization

### Abstract

**Hi, I'm yuqili, 19th undergraduate in JIT.**

**I'm in SE college(software engineering). Unfortunately, I'm not interested in the lessons taught in school at all and I'm crazy about learning AI.**

**I have to say, we must make what we are to seek completely clear. So, follow your mind and don't waste your life if you are not interested in the lessons in school like me.**

**That's why I create the Repo. As you know, credits are significant even if we don't care, since it decides whether you can graduate from JIT.**

**If you have to do something you yearn for and have no time or interest in learning school courses, you could star, fork and follow me.**

**Good Luck~**

### Repo structure

```c
├──lib: functions library I encapsulated
│  ├──tool.h
│  ├──tool.c: supply small tool function
│  ├──number.h
│  ├──number.c: represents unsigned number, signed number, float
│  ├──calculate.h
│  └──calculate.c: add or sub signed or unsigned number & add float & mul unsigned number
├──main.c: you can run the project via the c file
```

**running the project in CLion is recommended~~**
